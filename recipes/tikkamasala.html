    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks in a spiced sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was first offered by British cooks of south Asian origin and subsequently gained popularity at restaurants around the world.</p>
      <p>Some believe that it was invented in the 1970s by a Bangladeshi chef in Glasgow, Scotland, who, in order to please a customer, added a mild tomato-cream sauce to his chicken tikka, which is pieces of boneless chicken marinated in yogurt and curry spices and served on a skewer, kebab-style.</p>

        <li>When you are ready, preheat grill. Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers. Grill, turning occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Remove chicken from skewers. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onions. Saute for 2-3 minutes or until lightly browned. Add ginger. Saute until aromatic. Add ground turmeric, ground coriander, paprika and red chili powder. Saute for a minute. Add tomato paste and fry for a few seconds. Now add in the tomatoes. Saute until they are soft and mushy. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes.</li>
