    <h1>Chicken Provencal</h1>

    <img src="./images/chickenprovencal.jpeg" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chicken Provençal transforms regular old chicken thighs into a white wine-braised, olive-y, garlicky feat of culinary delight. Just add crusty bread and plenty of rosé.</p>
      <p>The flavors are bold in chicken Provençal, a southern French braise with a sauce of tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, olives, and just enough anchovy paste to give the sauce depth.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Diced Chicken</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Red Wine</li>
        <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Dried Rosemary</li>
        <li>Dried Thyme</li>
        <li>Black Olives</li>
        <li>Anchovy Paste</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large, deep frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper and put it in the pan. Cook the chicken until browned, turning, about 8 minutes in all. Remove the chicken from the pan. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pan.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to moderately low. Add the onion and the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the wine to the pan and simmer until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, rosemary, thyme, olives, anchovy paste, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and any accumulated juices. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and serve.</li>
      </ol>
